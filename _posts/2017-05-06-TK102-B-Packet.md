title: TK-102B GPS Tracker Packet
---

Recently i'm working with TK-102B GPS Tracker to make realtime bus tracker which will be accessible via Android phone. I was able to configure the device to send GPS information to my server. Unfortunalely, it's sent in specific format that's not described in device's manual.

Digging information to parse this data was harder than i imagined. But thanks to [traccar](https://traccar.org) and other project on github that i unfortunately i can't remember, i finally manage to parse this information after reading their source code.

### Packet Formats
This GPS tracker device send information in (at least) three possible formats:
* `(089072975034BO01255170422V0746.2053S11022.3651E000.1085146000.00,510,011,25323,45481,16,25323,34627,15,25323,45482,15,00000000L00000000)`
* `(087072975034BR00170426V0746.2066S11022.3650E000.2075501000.00,510,011,25323,45481,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,00000000L00000000)`
* `087072975034BP00HSO` (this one is probably handshake message)

These formats have same first 12 characters which is its unique identifier. It's built by prepending `0` to last 11 digits of IMEI. Then it's followed by `'B'+...n chars` which is probably command idenfifier. After that, information about gps and device informations follow.

### Parsing
After which figuring part of message i do need, i write a simple script to test it.
{% gist aldogint/f350d44037dff96de414106bc04caea9 %}

That's it, we can finally parse message sent by this device.
